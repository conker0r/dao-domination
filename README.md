# dao-domination

## purpose
Dao Domination is a attempting to provide a fun way to expierment with dao (decentralized autonomous orginization) governance mechanisms by allowing daos to compete against each other in an online game of the Domination/Risk board game. Perhaps one day wars will be fought by decentralized groups of coordinated, and this game variant hopes to explore what that might look like.

## specification
Dao Domination will attempt to imitate the board game as accurately as possible, with the caveat that every decision a player would normally make, must instead be voted on. There will be the option for player buy in, with the bulk of the prize pool going to the winner. Some rewards will be distributed for length of participation in the game, to encourgae daos to keep participating even if hope seems lost. 

In order to trust the outcome of the game, the current game state will be kept on-chain. The design also intends to leverage a modification of an open source Java implementation of Domination, for a fleshed out user interface.
